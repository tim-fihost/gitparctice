Networking protocols are sets of rules and conventions that govern how devices communicate and exchange data over a network. They ensure that devices understand each other's language and can effectively transmit and receive information. Here are some commonly used networking protocols:

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that guarantees the delivery of data packets in the order they were sent. It establishes a reliable connection between devices by managing packet acknowledgment, retransmission, and flow control.

Internet Protocol (IP): IP is the principal communication protocol of the Internet. It's responsible for routing data packets across networks, providing addressing and fragmentation, and ensuring the delivery of packets to the correct destination.

User Datagram Protocol (UDP): UDP is a connectionless protocol that provides faster communication but doesn't guarantee packet delivery or order. It's commonly used for real-time applications like video streaming, online gaming, and VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol).

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP): ICMP is used for diagnostic and control purposes in IP networks. It includes functions like error reporting, network testing (e.g., ping), and informing routers about network congestion.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It defines how web browsers and web servers communicate, enabling the retrieval and display of web content such as HTML pages, images, and videos.

File Transfer Protocol (FTP): FTP is used for transferring files between a client and a server on a network. It provides a standard set of commands for accessing, uploading, and downloading files.

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): SMTP is used for sending email messages between servers. It defines how email clients communicate with mail servers to send messages.

Post Office Protocol (POP) and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP): POP and IMAP are protocols used by email clients to retrieve messages from a mail server. POP typically downloads emails to the client's device, while IMAP allows users to manage messages directly on the server.

Domain Name System (DNS): DNS translates domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses. It enables users to access websites using human-readable names instead of numerical IP addresses.

These are just a few examples of networking protocols, and there are many more that serve various purposes in computer networks.
